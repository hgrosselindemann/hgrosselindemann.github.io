Hello, I am a PhD Student in Climate Sciences at the University of Bern and the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research. My research is on modeling ocean carbon removal and sequestration with a focus on the marine carbon cycle in the climate system and investigating possibilities to increase the ocean’s carbon uptake to lower atmospheric CO2-concentrations. I study climate sciences to enhance the society's knowledge on the impacts of human interaction with the climate system and in particular to help tackle global warming.
