Hello, I am a Master student in Climate Physics at the Geomar Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. I am interested in all kinds of ocean and climate processes, have worked on different things and I dont have the one topic yet. I am mostly interested in process understanding of dynamical aspects in our climate system. Additionally, I am curious about more hands on scientific questions that could help the society in tackling climate change. Of course, basic research is important to better understand the climate system and ultimately improve future projections. However, I am thinking about using my knowledge in fields, where I see a more direct connection to societal problems, for example renewable energy or carbon dioxide removal. I am also interested in the communication of scientific expertise to a broader audience and making aware of the issues we are facing.
