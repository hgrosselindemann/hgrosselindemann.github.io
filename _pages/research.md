# Marine Heatwaves

I have investigated marine heatwaves and their depth structure on the Northeast US continental shelf using a high resolution ocean model (VIKING20X, nemo-configuration). I validated the model against satellite surface measurements as well as against a long-term temperature and velocity transect across the gulf stream path. This ensured us that we can rely on the model output to do analysis about the regional ocean dynamics. Marine heatwaves have been detected and  investigated about their spatial and temporal characteristics with a focus on the vertical structure. We found various depth structures, with some heatwaves not having a surface signal while large anomalies at depth. The highest anomalies were found at depth at the shelf break with up to $7\textdegree C$. These events could be linked to warm core rings of the Gulf Stream. This shows the importance of the local dynamics for marine heatwave formation. More information can be found in Grosselindemann and Ryan et al. 2022 (Publications).
